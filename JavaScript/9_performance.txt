At Airtel Digital, I was actively involved in optimizing the Recharge and Homepage components, which were critical to user interactions. To achieve a 20% improvement in application performance, I focused on several key strategies. First, I conducted a thorough analysis of the existing code to identify performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders, large image files, and inefficient API calls. By using tools like Google's Lighthouse, I was able to measure the performance metrics and pinpoint areas that needed attention. Next, I optimized the React components by utilizing React.memo for memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This significantly reduced the time taken to render components when the props had not changed. I also implemented code-splitting using React.lazy and Suspense, which allowed large bundles to be split into smaller chunks that could be loaded on demand, further enhancing the user experience. In addition, I ensured that images used on the homepage were appropriately compressed and optimized for web usage, which reduced the load times dramatically. I also took the initiative to work closely with our backend team to improve the API response times by suggesting indexing strategies for our database. This collaborative approach ensured that both frontend and backend technologies were aligned, leading to a seamless user experience. Finally, I emphasized the importance of testing and monitoring. After deploying the changes, I used tools like Google Analytics to monitor user interactions and satisfaction scores, which steadily showed a uptick post-optimization. Overall, the combination of technical improvements, collaborative efforts, and user feedback played a pivotal role in significantly enhancing the applicationâ€™s performance.
