How Code is Executed in JavaScript

1. The execution context executes code in two phases a) memory creation phase, b) code execution phase
2. In Memory Creation Phase, JavaScrip will allocate memory to all the variables and functions.
3. Variables are stored as undefined and for functions the whole function definition is stored inside Memory
4. In Code Execution phase all the variables will be allocated the value assigned to them in the code
5. During Code Execution if a function is invoked a new execution context is created for that function
6. Once code is executed the execution context will be deleted
7. JavaScript has a call stack which handles all the execution context. whenever a new execution context is created it is pushed to the call stack
8. Call Stack manages the order of execution of all execution contexts
